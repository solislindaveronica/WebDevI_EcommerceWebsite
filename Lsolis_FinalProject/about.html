<p class="aboutus-story"><b> Our Story </b> <br> <br>
 My name is Linda Solis, I am the Co-founder of this amazing project. 
 I grew up in the back of the yards - south side of Chicago IL. 
 I learned how to work with wood and Woodburn during my teenage years. 
 My childhood church offered wood shop classes for teens and that is where I learned the art of wood burning.
Every product made is dedicated to everyone who contributed to make my childhood a success and all those who support our mission and vision. 
My love to building wood burning art also called pyrography is thanks to my professors and parents who made it possible and supported me along my way. 
We have created this store full of dreams with the purpose to continue to grow as a person and help while we climb.
